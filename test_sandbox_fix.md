# Sandbox Testing Fix Guide

## 1. Create a Fresh Sandbox Account
- Go to App Store Connect → Users and Access → Sandbox Testers
- Create a NEW account (use a unique email like test_aug21_2@example.com)
- Use a simple password
- Fill all required fields

## 2. Clear All Caches
1. Delete app from simulator
2. Reset simulator: Device → Erase All Content and Settings
3. Rebuild app with clean cache:
   - Command+Shift+K in Xcode (Clean Build Folder)
   - Delete DerivedData: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

## 3. Test with Beta User Instead
Since it works with your beta account, use that for now:
- In TestFlight, you're already using production-like environment
- This confirms your setup is correct

## 4. Wait for Sandbox Sync
- Sandbox environment can take 24-48 hours to sync new products
- Your product was likely just created recently
